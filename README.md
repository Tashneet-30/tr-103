### Week 3 (June 24 - June 30, 2024)

#### Chapter 3: Results and Discussion

**3.1 Overview of Experimental Results**

In this chapter, we explore the results of the "Deep Scene Fusion" model, focusing on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of its performance. The goal of these experiments was to evaluate the model’s ability to accurately recognize scenes across various categories and to compare its performance against traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix analysis, and computational efficiency were examined.

The training and evaluation were conducted using two prominent scene recognition datasets: MIT Places and SUN datasets, providing a comprehensive range of indoor, outdoor, urban, and natural environments. The results of the "Deep Scene Fusion" model demonstrate significant improvements in scene recognition accuracy while revealing limitations and areas for further improvement.

**3.2 Quantitative Evaluation of the Hybrid Model**

**3.2.1 Accuracy**  
The accuracy of the "Deep Scene Fusion" model was evaluated on both the MIT Places and SUN datasets:
- **MIT Places Dataset Accuracy**: The model achieved an accuracy of 87.2%, significantly improving over baseline CNN models (75%-80%).
- **SUN Dataset Accuracy**: On the SUN dataset, the model achieved an accuracy of 85.5%. 

The fusion layer’s ability to integrate multiple information sources contributed to this performance boost.

**3.2.2 Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**  
- **Precision**: Average precision of 0.88 on the MIT Places dataset indicates that most positive predictions were correct.
- **Recall**: Average recall was 0.85, suggesting successful identification of a large proportion of actual scenes.
- **F1-Score**: The hybrid model achieved an F1-score of 0.865, reflecting a strong balance between precision and recall.

**3.2.3 Confusion Matrix Analysis**  
The confusion matrix revealed strengths and weaknesses:
- **Strengths**: High accuracy in distinct visual categories like beaches and kitchens.
- **Weaknesses**: Struggled with categories with high visual similarity, such as streets vs. highways.

**3.2.4 Comparison with Traditional CNN Models**  
The "Deep Scene Fusion" model outperformed traditional CNNs:
- **VGG-16**: 78.5% accuracy; struggled with complex scenes.
- **ResNet-50**: 82.1% accuracy; performed better but lacked fusion capability.
- **DenseNet-121**: 81.8% accuracy; plateaued in multi-scale feature fusion.

**3.2.5 Qualitative Analysis of the Results**  
- **Successful Predictions**: Correctly predicted scenes with strong features (e.g., beaches).
- **Challenging Scenes**: Misclassifications occurred in ambiguous scenarios (e.g., urban environments).
- **Boundary Cases**: Scenes with blurred indoor/outdoor boundaries posed challenges.

**3.3 Computational Efficiency and Scalability**

**3.3.1 Training Time**  
Training the hybrid model required more computational resources:
- **MIT Places Dataset**: Approximately 30 hours on multiple GPUs, a 50% increase compared to single CNN architectures.

**3.3.2 Inference Speed**  
Inference speed considerations:
- **Inference Time per Image**: Average of 150 milliseconds, slower than traditional CNNs.

Optimization strategies like model pruning and quantization were discussed for potential improvements.
